Database association:
The new column acme_custom_attribute is added to the catalog_product_option_type_value table. This table stores information about custom option values for products. Each row in this table is already associated with a specific product option value.
Product association:
The association between this new attribute and a specific product happens indirectly:

Each product can have custom options
Each custom option can have multiple values
Each value row in the catalog_product_option_type_value table includes a reference to the product option it belongs to
The product option, in turn, is associated with a specific product


UI integration:
The Ui/DataProvider/Product/Form/Modifier/CustomOptionAttribute.php file modifies the product edit form to include the new attribute in the custom options section. This allows merchants to set and edit the value for each product option.
Data saving:
The tutorial doesn't explicitly show how the data is saved, but typically, Magento would handle this automatically based on the form structure and database schema.

To make the association clearer and more explicit, you might want to consider the following additions to the tutorial:

Add a comment in the db_schema.xml file to explain the relationship:
```xml
<column xsi:type="varchar" name="acme_custom_attribute" nullable="true" length="255" comment="Acme Custom Attribute for Product Option Value"/>
```
In the CustomOptionAttribute.php UI modifier, you could add a comment explaining the context:

```php
// This modifier adds the custom attribute to each option value
// in the product's custom options section
protected function getCustomAttributeConfig()
{
    // ...
}
```
You might want to create a model and resource model for handling the data, which would make the associations more explicit in the code.
Consider adding code to save and load the custom attribute value, which would make it clearer how the data flows between the product, its options, and this new attribute.

Remember, the actual association between this attribute and a specific product happens through the existing relationships in Magento's product and custom option structures. This new attribute becomes an additional piece of data for each custom option value, which is already tied to a specific product.
